# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). The solutions are written in Ruby 3.0 using Ruby's new typechecking functionality via RBS and [Steep](https://github.com/soutaro/steep). I have three goals for this project:

1. Learn more about Ruby type checking
2. Practice object oriented code design
3. Practice test-driven development
